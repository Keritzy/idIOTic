id-IOT-ic : Simple ways to pop simple devices.
=========

idIOTic is a tool that makes attacks on some "IOT" devices "point and click"
simple. It has an interactive CLI. It is also modular so that that as new
"IOT" vulns are published they can be quickly added to this tool without
modification of the code for the tool itself (just drop the new .py into the modules
directory and a command for it is added to the CLI).

This tool accompanies the [Insecurity Of Things](http://www.xipiter.com/musings/the-insecurity-of-things-part-one)
blogpost series at Xipiter. As new vulns are disclosed their exploit "modules" will be added
to this simple little tool.

```
tachiro:idIOTic s7$ ./idIOTic.py 
Loading 'modules.sucasa' as a 'simple' idIOTic execute module...
Loading 'modules.wemo' as a 'simple' idIOTic execute module...
